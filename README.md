## 👋 Greetings friend!

19 years old / 4 years of development

I am a very motivated developer with an authentic passion for making games. I taught myself how to code by hopping around game jams until I wanted to turn game development into my career. The best part is creating a lasting impression through the emotion, impact, and immersion of the experience.

🖋️ I'm currently working on a package called "Accent" \
🏗️ I want to improve my profile with some interactive pages sometime soon
